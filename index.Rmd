## Bio

Nadhifah is a physician currently pursuing an MPH degree at Johns Hopkins University. Prior to this, she also worked as a research assistant in the pediatric department at Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. My area of interest is children's and adolescents‚Äô health. Previously, my work primarily focused on children‚Äôs nutrition, nephrology, and growth and development. At present, I am refining my skills in quantitative data analysis, data science, and health economics to gain a deeper understanding of the complex nature of children‚Äôs health. I aspire to be a global-level pediatrician while actively contributing to medical education & research.

## Five fun facts about me

- üå∂Ô∏è I have a really high spice tolerance (hit me with all those chili peppers)
- üéº Laufey is my favorite singer and you should listen to "letter to my 13 year old self"
- üê± I have two cats named "Kumkum" and "Bubu"
- üöû My father works in a bank, so I moved frequently from one city to another as a child
- üéÆ I enjoy swimming, walking, gaming, eating, and watching series such as Mr. Robot

## Something Cool

There is an Instagram account that I really like, called [The Woke Salaryman](https://www.instagram.com/thewokesalaryman/), because it posts about day-to-day issues (financial, relationships, career, higher education) from various perspectives that feel genuinely authentic, allowing us to tackle our "adult" problems more wisely. It is everyone's first life indeed, so please take a minute to appreciate yourself.

## Personal Expectations

I have no prior experience in coding, nor have I ever attempted to code before. Nevertheless, I have always thought that people who can code are really cool. I am really thrilled to know that Hopkins offered the 140.776.01 ‚Äì Statistical Computing class. This class was also recommended by one of the Epidemiology teaching assistants, named Kobbie. He said that this is one of his favorite classes of all time. To be honest, I was initially terrified because I'm not a tech-savvy person, but the step-by-step instructions really helped me push through. I was having a lot of fun making this, one code at a time!
